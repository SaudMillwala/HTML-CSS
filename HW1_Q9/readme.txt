entering January and submitting the form. Then enter a J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J—January should be displayed below the input element. Enter June and submit the form again. Now enter a J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J—
January and June should be displayed below the input element. Try this with your own search queries as well.
