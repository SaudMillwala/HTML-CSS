A company wants to transmit data over the telephone, but itâ€™s concerned that its phones
may be tapped. All of its data is transmitted as four-digit integers. It has asked you to write a script
that will encrypt its data so that the data may be transmitted more securely. Your script should read
a four-digit integer entered by the user in a prompt dialog and encrypt it as follows: Replace each
digit by (the sum of that digit plus 7) modulus 10. Then swap the first digit with the third, and swap
the second digit with the fourth. Then output HTML5 text that displays the encrypted integer.
