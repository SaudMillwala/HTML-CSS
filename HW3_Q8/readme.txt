Computers are playing an increasing role in education. Write a program that will help an
elementary-school student learn multiplication. Use Math.random to produce two positive one-digit
integers. It should then display a question such as
How much is 6 times 7?
The student then types the answer into a text field. Your program checks the student’s answer. If it’s
correct, display the string "Very good!" and generate a new question. If the answer is wrong, display the string "No. Please try again." and let the student try the same question again repeatedly
until he or she finally gets it right. A separate function should be used to generate each new question. This function should be called once when the script begins execution and each time the user
answers the question correctly
