Add an embedded style sheet to the HTML5 document in Fig. 2.3. The style sheet should
contain a rule that displays h1 elements in blue. In addition, create a rule that displays all links in
blue without underlining them. When the mouse hovers over a link, change the linkâ€™s background
color to yellow.
