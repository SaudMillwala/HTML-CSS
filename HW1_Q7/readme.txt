A local university has asked you to create an HTML5 document that allows prospective college students to provide feedback about their campus visit. Your HTML5 document should contain
a form with text fields for a name and e-mail. Provide checkboxes that allow prospective students to indicate what they liked most about the campus. The checkboxes should include: campus, students,
location, atmosphere, dorm rooms and sports. Also, provide radio buttons that ask the prospective
students how they became interested in the college. Options should include: friends, television, Internet and other. In addition, provide a text area for additional comments, a submit button and a
reset button. Use post to sent the information in the form to http://www.deitel.com.
