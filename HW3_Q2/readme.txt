A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backward and forward. For
example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611.
Write a script that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether it’s a palindrome. If the number is not five digits long, display an alert dialog indicating the problem to the user. Allow the user
to enter a new value after dismissing the alert dialog. [Hint: It’s possible to do this exercise with the techniques learned in this chapter. You’ll need to use both division and remainder operations to
“pick off” each digit.]
