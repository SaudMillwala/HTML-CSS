One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts (sometimes
called histograms). Write a script that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. For each number read,
output HTML5 text that displays a line containing the same number of adjacent asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should output HTML5 text that displays *******.
